# Group Header Collabs
__tl;dr: Add your works to this repository. Every two weeks we'll pick a new image to be used as the group cover photo.__

There are a lot of great works shared on the Facebook group, and some of them might get pushed down the newsfeed by newer posts, and not get the attention they truly deserve.

This repository was created to promote the works of our members. We will use the images you submit here as a group cover photo. Every image will be kept for two weeks, and then it will be replaced with another one from this repository.

You can also share the code you used to create your works. This way you could help other members understand how you got to a specific result.

When pushing to this repo, please try to use the folowing folder structure:

```
your_firstName_lastName
  |   hi.md
  ├───projectNameFolder
      |
      ├───codeFolder
          | codeDocument.file
          ...
      ├───imageFolder
          | imageDocument.jpg
          ...
```    
In the __hi.md__ file you can add any details about you, like your full name, portfolio or any other links you consider important.

Try to keep the size of the images around 784 x 250 px otherwise Facebook will crop them.
